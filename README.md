---HOW TO START THE GAME---
Open the included index.html file in a browser such as Google Chrome. The game will automatically start.

---THE GOAL---
You start at the bottom of the screen. Using the arrow keys, try to reach the water at the top of
the screen.

Don't run in to bugs, or you'll lose a health! (Represented by the hearts in the upper right.) If
you lose all of your health you'll lose the game.

Your goal is to reach the safety of the water on all 50 levels. Successive levels gradually
increase the speed and number of the bugs you must evade.

Look both ways while you're crossing! Bugs travel in different directions on different levels.

---CONTROLS---
Use the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to move.

Use the C key to change your avatar. You can only change your avatar while still in the safety of
the grass.
